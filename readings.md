Links are either to open resources, or canvas (only accessible to registered students).

## Week 0

Pre-lecture reading:

**Read** the article:
[*Putin’s Peaks: Russian Election Data Revisited.*](https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1689180/files/folder/Readings?preview=72232056) Kobak, Dmitry, Sergey Shpilkin, and Maxim S. Pshenichnikov. n.d.  Significance 15 (3): 8–9

Be prepared to answer the following questions in class:

1. What feature of Figure 1 do the authors argue is evidence for election fraud?

2. For a particular year, say 2018, how do the authors measure the statistical significance of the feature in Figure 1?  What statistic do they calculate?  What do they compare that statistic to? 

  
## Week 1

Pre-lecture reading:  

* [*Section 3.1 Pseudorandom Number Generation* in Simulation](https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1689180/files/folder/Readings?preview=72232060) (1 page)
* [*Section 4.1 The Inverse Transform Method* in Simulation](https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1689180/files/folder/Readings?preview=72232059) up to and inlcuding Example 4a (~ 2 pages)
* [*Section 5.1 The Inverse Transform Algorithm* in Simulation](https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1689180/files/folder/Readings?preview=72232058) up to and including Example 5b (~ 2 pages)

Be prepared to answer:

* Why are random numbers generated by a computer called **pseudo**-random numbers?
* How would you use a Uniform$(0, 1)$ random variable to simulate a Bernoulli$(\pi)$ random variable?
* How would you use a Uniform$(0, 1)$ random variable to simulate a Exponential$(\lambda)$ random variable?
